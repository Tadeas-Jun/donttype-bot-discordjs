# Don't Type - A Discord Bot Filled With Hatred
This bot will start yelling at everyone who starts to type in a Discord channel.

## Use
In order to use this bot, change the `message` variable to whatever you want your message to be.
Change the bot's token in the very last line to the token of your Discord application.
Change the information in the `package.json` file to reflect your bot's data.
You can set up a list of ignored people by inputting user IDs into the `ignoredMembers` array.

*The `README.md` and `LICENSE` files do not have to be included in the bot's folder. All other files do.*

Run the bot via NodeJS by running the `node bot.js` command locally, or set up online hosting.
